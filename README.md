In competitive sports, it is rare to find such an important situation where there is a heavy reliance on luck rather than skill. This arcade game tries to mimic the odds the goalie and the shooter have of winning this duel. I chose to make 'Beat the Keeper' because of a life-long love of playing soccer. I have also always enjoyed playing sports related computer games growing up. I used photoshop to create the visuals and css to make the animations. Some roadblocks I encountered while creating the game included timing the animation of the ball, goalies dive, and goal screen so that they do not overlap. I would also like to give the user the ability to shoot to additional areas of the goal without unrealistically increasing the odds of the user winning, but I did not come to a solution to this dilemma. Lastly, a future upgrade would likely include better animation for the goalies dive, utilizing sprites and stopmotion. Hope you enjoy and good luck!
